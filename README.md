# Stock Market Dashboard
- The stock market is a very tedious task to understand, and more difficult is to operate its application and track your stock.
- We will create a dashboard where you can add stocks based on their symbols and on the type of data you want.
- We will use the [alphavantage.co](https://www.alphavantage.co/) API for this.
